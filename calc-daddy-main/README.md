PMT = P * r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)  
Where:  
- `P` = Loan amount  
- `r` = Monthly interest rate  
- `n` = Total number of payments

---

### 2. Compound Interest Calculator
**Formula with contributions**:  
FV = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt) + PMT √ó [((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)]  
- `P` = Initial principal  
- `PMT` = Monthly contribution  
- `r` = Annual interest rate  
- `n` = Compounding frequency  
- `t` = Time in years

ROI = (Gain - Cost) / Cost √ó 100%
